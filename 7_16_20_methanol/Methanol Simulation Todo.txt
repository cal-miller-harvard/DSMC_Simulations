Methanol Simulation Todo

-Write script to generate input file for first stage containing axial and lateral methanol inlets
    -surfaces should be divided into small pieces for granular statistics
-Write SPARTA script for methanol simulation
    -define new fluid with collision cross section
        -Compute methanol VHS parameter from viscosity:
            See https://pubs-acs-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1021/je050429b 
    -define inlet
    -define sticking probability for methanol
    -add compute react commands and associated averaging and output files
    -write termination based on particle number convergence (doesn't increase over 100K iterations?)
-Write Julia run script
    -Try YbOH and CaOH configurations with 50%, 99% sticking probabilities
-Write analysis code
    -Plot surfaces color coded by methanol sticking per unit area per unit time
    -Plot comparison of He temperature, velocity with and without methanol
